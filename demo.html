      <div>This is the google-map-storyboard Polymer element. Inside a 
        storyboard, there are scenes (google-map-scene), and inside each scene 
        there is content.  Notice that down the bottom it tells you how many 
        pieces of content there are at this scene. 
        Click on the marker to show the next piece of content.</div>
      <div>This is the last piece of content for this scene.  If you click on 
        the marker again, you go back to the first piece of content.  To 
        proceed to the next scene, click the forward arrow or the play button 
        at the bottom of the map.</div>
    </google-map-scene>
    <google-map-scene id="scenesWithImages" address="Melbourne, Australia">
      <div>Content can also be images. Please click on the marker.</div>

    <google-map-scene id="changeAddress" address="Adelaide, Australia">
      <div>If an invalid address is given, the scene won't be shown.  If the 
        address is changed, the location of the scene will change in 
        real time.</div>
    </google-map-scene>
    <google-map-scene id="startUsingDevTools" address="Perth, Australia">
      <div>Now open up the developer tools if you are using Chrome.</div>
      <div>You can set the current scene by changing the current attribute in 
        the storyboard and setting it to the scene id you want to jump to.
        For example, jump two scenes back by setting current to 
        "scenesWithImages".</div>
      <div>Using the dev tools, you can also add and remove scenes 
        on the fly.</div>
